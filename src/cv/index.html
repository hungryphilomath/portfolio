					<h2>Profile</h2>
					<p>I am a freelance, front-end web developer with over <span id="experience-years">3</span> years of experience in creating mobile-first, responsive websites and interactive web apps, particularly ones that communicate with developer APIs.   In my work I aim to write fast, efficient code and due to my perceptive nature I have a high attention to detail that enables me to develop ‘pixel perfect’, cross-browser layouts.  I am a creative person who enjoys implementing unique features, taking on demanding challenges and learning new skills.</p>
					<p>Before my coding career I was a cleanroom process engineer with eight years of semiconductor fabrication experience, working at the University of Southampton.  It was there that I completed PhD and master’s degrees in electronic engineering from which I gained the confidence and ability to quickly understand unfamiliar and challenging topics.  This quality enabled me to teach myself programming in my spare time after realising a profound passion for creation through coding.  Eventually I freelanced part-time developing websites to enhance my skills until I possessed the confidence to quit my job and pursue a full-time career in web and software development.</p>

					<h2>Software Skills</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Expert in <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>.</li>
						<li>Extensive experience interacting with <strong>APIs</strong> using <strong>AJAX</strong>.</li>
						<li>Experienced with <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>.</li>
						<li>Confident in the use of <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong>.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Personal Skills</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Exceptional problem-solving skills with a well-structured and logic-based approach.</li>
						<li>Extremely adaptable and capable of quickly understanding unfamiliar topics.</li>
						<li>Highly effective communication skills and ability to easily explain complex topics to non-technical people.</li>
						<li>Excellent organisation, multitasking, leadership and project management skills.</li>
					</ul>


					<h2>Interests and Activities</h2>

					<p>I greatly enjoy software development and during my days as an engineer I spent my spare time teaching myself to code.  Despite being a fully capable front-end developer I frequently learn, practice and keep up to date with new techniques, frameworks and languages, and am hence currently learning AngularJS with the intention to learn Angular 4.  Code is not the only thing I enjoy writing, however, as I also pen short stories and screenplays and am very interested in the art of film-making.</p>
					<p>Travelling has always been another interest of mine and I have visited and lived in many cities around the world, experiencing a diversity of cultures.  From my travels I have learned to be adaptable and resourceful, and have developed great cultural awareness.</p>
					<p>At university I played an active role in organising social and sporting events.  During my second year I held the position of founding vice president of the school’s first official student society.  In this role I learned team leading and organisation strategies, as well as the importance of diplomacy in team situations.</p>
