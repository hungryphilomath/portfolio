					<p>...1022...1023...1024.</p>
					<p>1024 holes in each of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom">cleanroom</a>'s perforated floor tiles. The holes, primarily for air-flow purposes and not for bored process engineers to count, were grouped in blocks of 4 by 4 repeated 8 times both horizontally and vertically. This formation of course  meant the holes could've been counted with a few quick multiplications, but that would've defeated the purpose of killing as much of the forty minutes needed to pump down the vacuum chamber of the electron-beam evaporator to operating pressure... for the forth time that day.  It was with the whispering of that final number that I realised something. I wasn't enjoying what I was doing. I wasn't engaged. I wasn't happy.</p>

					<p>It wasn't always like that, you see. I actually enjoyed the job at one point, but that was tens of automated processes ago, back in the days I spent creating recipes and procedures rather than just executing them. When I got home that evening I knew the writing was on the wall and I had to do something about it. I asked myself if I could do anything for a living what would it be. The answer was simple. A movie writer-director. So I asked myself what <em>else</em> and the second thing that came to mind was coding. I remembered how much fun I had coding during my degree and how interested I was in learning software engineering practices and principles. So I began to plan my exit strategy. I was going to spend almost all of my free time learning to code. But what? Which language? Which platform? To what end? After a bit of confusion and a lot of research I decided my preferred goal was to become a full stack developer, and to start with front-end development. At first my goal was to learn all the languages, frameworks and libraries used to create the front-end of websites... that is until I saw how many there were.</p>

					<p>To simplify things I began with the basics of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>, with the intention to figure out what the hell the other ones were later. I used a combination of books, online coding courses like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, YouTube playlists, and good ol' practice to learn how to put elements on the page with HTML and position, style and animate them with CSS. At first I used Notepad++ for development but got tired of the aesthetics so switched to Sublime Text, which is what I use now along with occasional use of Atom.io. To keep track of what I was learning and to take detailed notes I started using <strong>Markdown</strong> which I find to be a great way to write quick, well-formatted notes. I also got tired of constantly refreshing the browser to see the results after each edit so after a bit of research I discovered <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/">browsersync</a>, a program that refreshes the browser whenever specified files are changed.</p>

					<p>Once I got the hang of CSS I started getting into CSS preprocessors that made coding faster and easier. I looked at LESS, COMPASS and <strong>SASS</strong> and chose the latter due to its higher adoption rate. I chose LibSass over the Ruby library because of its faster performance and went with <a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass">node-sass</a> as my LibSass wrapper.  I run both browsersync and node-sass in a bash terminal using Bash on Linux on Windows.

					<p>It was then on to <strong>Javascript</strong> and because of its similarities to C which I learned at university it did not take long to get up and running with it. I spent a lot of time learning how to write efficient code with an emphasis on performance. It was at this point I started working with <strong>JQuery</strong> for simplicity. I then started using <strong>AJAX</strong> requests to interact with developer APIs such as those provided by Twitter, themoviedatabase and YouTube.</p>

					<p>With HTML, CSS and Javascript in my tech stack I started developing websites specifically focusing on cross-browser compatibility and responsive, mobile-first development. For better responsive development <strong>Bootstrap 3</strong> was my next step due to its increased demand and use in recent years. After further research I realised that developers create websites mainly from <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Sketch</strong> design files created by designers, so learning how to use them to extract information needed for development was my next task. As my projects became bigger and more complex I added version control software <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> to my skills to keep track of changes.  To allow my clients to manage their own content I learned how to convert my websites to <strong>WordPress</strong> and create custom themes from scratch, which involved learning <strong>PHP</strong>. I also picked up <strong>AngularJS</strong> and have been working with that for the past 2 years. At the time of writing this I am currently learning the ins and outs of <strong>React</strong>.</p>

					<p>As you can see it's been a long and challenging road to get from where I was to where I am now, and although there are many more miles to cover I'm enjoying every minute and am glad I started this road trip of a lifetime!</p>
